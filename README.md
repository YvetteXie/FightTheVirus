# FightTheVirus
FightTheVirus is available on both web and IOS platform. The main mission is to utilize machine learning to predict the probability of a person having Coronavirus based on attributes such as gender, age, fever, cough, headache, breathing, travel history in Wuhan and China, and sputum. We trained the data of 150 confirmed and suspected cases of patients and by the model of Logistic Regression, we are able to compute the probability. Also, on our app, we have tips section that included all the information that people need to know about Coronavirus. Lastly, we integrated machine learning again to display projected data -- the number of confirmed cases, suspected cases, deaths and recoveries to remind everyone of our situation in order to prepare for it.
